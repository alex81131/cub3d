# cub3d
A ray-casting game: an advanced graphical project where we create a simplified 3D game, whose goal is to learn a rendering technique called ray casting.

## Key Concepts
1. Parsing Maps, Wall texture paths, and initializing images.
2. Use a recursive function (floodfill) to check if a Map is valid that the player will never go outside of bound.
3. Building a vector library for vector calculations (optional)
4. What is Raycasting and how it helps to make 3D rendering efficient?
5. What is DDA algorithm? Why it helps to optimize rendering?
6. Rendering images in a resized fashion (Wall texture rendering)
7. Create multiple images and put in in the same window (Mini map, Sprite)
8. Create a script of frames and generate animation effects (Animation)
